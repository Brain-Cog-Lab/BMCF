# Audio-Visual Prompts in Class-Incremental Learning- Pytorch
Here is the PyTorch implementation of our paper. （Prompt middle version）

**Paper Title: "Better Multimodal Cue Fusion: Incorporating Audio-Visual Prompts in Class-Incremental Learning"**







## Acknowledgements

Our code was built based on [https://github.com/weiguoPian/AV-CIL_ICCV2023](https://github.com/weiguoPian/AV-CIL_ICCV2023), and the audio-visual datasets used can all be found in that project as well, thanks to their excellent work!  The SNN implementation is based on [Brain-Cog](https://github.com/BrainCog-X/Brain-Cog).  

If you are confused about using it or have other feedback and comments, please feel free to contact us via hexiang2021@ia.ac.cn. Have a good day!
